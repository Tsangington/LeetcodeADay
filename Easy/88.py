88. Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order,
 and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 
 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead 
be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, n
ums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements 
that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. 
nums2 has a length of n.
